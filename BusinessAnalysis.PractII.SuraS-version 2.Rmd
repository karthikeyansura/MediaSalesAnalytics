# Background

Media Distributors, Inc. is a Wichita, KY based distributor and seller of films and music for commercial purposes. For the past few years, it has managed its film and music sales separately using different applications. This division is historical as Media Distributors started distributing films and then acquired SoundMania about two years ago. As the two distribution channels were different, CTO Alvin Coelho made the decision not to integrate the SoundMania's information systems and database with those of Media Distributors. This has not been a problem until now, however Media Distributors intends to make itself available for acquisition. To that end, an integrated view of the business, particularly sales, is needed.

This report provides key sales, revenue, and customer metrics to showcase Media Distributors business. The analysis provided is based on data from a custom-built datamart containing data extracted from two operational databases.

# Key Business Metrics

The year with the most sales was `r max_revenue_year` with a total revenue across both business units of $`r max_revenue`. The country with the most sales was `r top_country` with total sales across both business units in `r previous_year` of $`r top_country_revenue`. It was followed by `r second_country` with $`r second_country_revenue`.

The table below shows sales revenue by country and ordered by total sales for the two most recent years, `r previous_year` and `r latest_year`. The table is restricted to the top five countries with the most sales. The column 'Total' in the table represents the total for all years for which there is data and not just the past two years.

The table below shows the revenue broken down by quarter for the top five countries. It shows the total revenue for each quarter across all business units and years. So, for example, the column "Q1" is the total sales for music and film for all years for which there is data, which is from `r min_year` to `r max_year`.

Based on the available data, the analysis of Media Distributors, Inc.'s film and music sales reveals a robust revenue generation pattern, with `r top_country` and `r second_country` emerging as the primary contributors to the company's total sales. Between `r min_year` and `r max_year`, sales peaked in `r peak_year`, with total revenue reaching $`r peak_revenue` across both business units. Film and music sales contribute `r film_percentage`% and `r music_percentage`% respectively to total revenue, but sales patterns fluctuate by quarter and geography. The customer base is concentrated in `r top_customer_countries`, which also serve as the top-performing markets.

Despite these strengths, Media Distributors, Inc. faces challenges related to its siloed information systems. With plans for acquisition, the company must present a cohesive and integrated business view to appeal to potential buyers. With nearly `r customer_count` customers across `r country_count` countries, Media Distributors should invest in customer relationship management (CRM) tools to personalize outreach and foster loyalty. Segmenting customers by preferences (film or music) and spending habits can optimize targeting.
